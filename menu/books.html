<h2>Inferno</h2>
<img src="/images/inferno.jpg">

<pre> 
<i>written by Dan Brown </i>
this is one of the books that make me love reading books.
the actions and the theme of the book never bored me and made me want to read more 
i read this book just  in 2 days and it is 573 pages 
after reading this book and being affected by it i decided to read Divine Comedy by Dante .

<h2>Divine Comedy</h2>
<img src="/images/dante.jpg" >
<pre>
<i>written by Dante </i>
this is a book that needs to be read with good tranlated version  because one of the features of this book is being poetic but when i read the book in my language i didn't like the translation book almost lost the meaning to me 
so i read some parts of the book from internet in english of course i didn't leard italian to read the book but english translators did a such a good job at keeping the poetic part of the book
<a href="https://digitaldante.columbia.edu/dante/divine-comedy/">This is a link to read it in good translation</a>

Death of Beatrice makes Dante write the divine comedy 
in the book <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Virgil">Virgil</a> guides Dante to inferno and purgatorio then 
Beatrice guides him to Paradise 
as i said book is meaningful to read with poetic translation so if you want to read it i suggest you to read it in english translation if you can italian but not turkish 
4 years ago i stopped using turkish translations if i can find english version of it i try to use it.
For example watching a anime or readin a comic ,because the translators doesn't bother with literature or poetic ways of a piece they just want to translate of course there ara some exceptions but very little .Translating is an important job because the translator creates the piece in language again so they have to have a knowledge of literature and manega both of the languages not just the foreign one for example 
a english-turkish translator must know english as much as turkish so the translated piece still have literaturel value from the mother language of it .

<h2>MR. Mercedes </h2>

<pre>
<i>written by Stephen King </i>
there is a quote that i really like from this book 
<q>Every religion lies. Every moral precept is a delusion. Even the stars are a mirage. The truth is darkness, and the only thing that matters is making a statement before one enters it. Cutting the skin of the world and leaving a scar. That’s all history is, after all: scar tissue.</q>
it is said by Mr. Mercedes 
 I don’t know what is about Stephen King's writing , but it really does not draw me in.I don't know why this book take me so long to finish actually plat wasn't bad but the writing didn't make me turn pages in the book  maybe the first time reading stephen king stunt me ...
