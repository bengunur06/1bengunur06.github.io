As always ,Dan Brown amazed me with his new book .
The effort that was put in the book was incredible .
Even the Domain for the news site in the book was prepared (although ,recently i thinks there are some errors i think i can't reach the website ) .
And the artificial intelligance refrences in the book and the evolution of the human kind was very exciting to read .
But to be honest -spoiler alert- after my favorite character -edmund- died i stopped reading for 1 week after that i could continue .
